# GoLang

Imports are just that: they import code and give you access to identifiers such as types, functions, constants, and interfaces. In our case, the code in the main.go code file can now reference the Run function from the search package, thanks to the import on line 08. On lines 04 and 05, we import code from the standard library for the log and os packages.

Here you see the use of the short variable declaration operator (:=). This operator is used to both declare and initialize variables at the same time. The type of each value being returned is used by the compiler to determine the type for each variable, respectively. The short variable declaration operator is just a shortcut to streamline your code and make the code more readable. The variable it declares is no different than any other variable you may declare when using the keyword var.
